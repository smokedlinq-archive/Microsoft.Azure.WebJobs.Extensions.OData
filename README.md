# Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.OData

This project is archived. The [current implementation can be found here](https://github.com/smokedlinq/Azure.Functions.Extensions/tree/master/src/OData), and is published as a [https://www.nuget.org/packages/AzureFunctions.Extensions.OData](NuGet package).

This is a proof-of-concept on how to expose a Microsoft.AspNetCore.OData compatible endpoint as an Azure Function HttpTrigger. This is not officially supported by Microsoft.
